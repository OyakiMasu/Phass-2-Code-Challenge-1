### Intro 
For this assignment we were dealing with React to create the bank of flatiron.

The bank of flatiron is used to display the previous transactions and being able to add transactons

### Requirements
* Having a well written README file (like this one)
* Fetch data from local server running JSON DB server

### Installations 
* npm install create-react-app
* npx create-react-app name of the app

### Project Setup
*Create a new project folder.
*Create a new GitHub repository (NB: ENSURE IT IS PUBLIC)
*Add your TM as a contributor to the project.

### Project Guidelines
As a user, I can:

*See a table of all transactions.
*Fill out and submit the form to add a new transaction.
*This should add the new transaction to the table *the new  transaction does not have to be persisted to the backend*
*Filter transactions by typing into the search bar. Only transactions with a description matching the search term should be shown in the transactions table.
